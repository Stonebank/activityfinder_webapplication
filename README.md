# activityfinder_webapplication

[Activity Finder](https://github.com/Stonebank/ActivityFinder) is a Java console application that takes use of the user's [geo location](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopositioning) and [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to suggest activities such as sight-seeing or adventuring. The application determines the suggestions by taking factors such as distance and weather in account.

The goal of this application is to create a stunning easy-to-use frontend website in which the user can find activity suggestions with a fast and effective backend.
